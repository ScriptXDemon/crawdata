"""Detect the wall before trying to climb it — and never claim a solve we cannot prove.

The evidence dicts below are REAL, captured from live pages through CamoFox on :9377, not invented.
Each one pins a defect that was measured in the shipped code:

  hcaptcha demo      -> was classified `recaptcha_v2` with sitekey None, so no solver task could
                        ever be built. hCaptcha writes `g-recaptcha-response` as well as its own
                        field, so any detector that checks reCAPTCHA first loses on every hCaptcha
                        page. Order is a correctness property here, not a style choice.
  cloudflare managed -> was classified as NO captcha at all. `.cf-turnstile` is absent on a managed
                        interstitial, so the single commonest real-world wall was invisible.
  vendor globals     -> grecaptcha/hcaptcha/turnstile all measured `undefined`, and so were the
                        three `setResponse` APIs the old injector called. Injection must be DOM-only.
