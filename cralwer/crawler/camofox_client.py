"""C3 — CamoFox stealth-render client (§ Tri-Crawler).

jo-inc/camofox-browser is a standalone anti-detection browser SERVER (a Firefox
fork with C++-engine-level fingerprint spoofing) exposing a REST API on :9377 —
NOT a Playwright target. We call it on demand as the WAF-block fallback (C3):
open a tab, read the accessibility snapshot (lightweight, LLM-ready text), close
the tab. The snapshot — not bloated HTML — IS the content, per the plan.

Disabled unless CAMOFOX_ENABLED=1, so the fallback ladder cleanly skips C3 when
no CamoFox server is deployed. Server URL via CAMOFOX_URL (default the compose
service http://camofox:9377). Every call is best-effort — returns None on any
error so the caller falls through to the archival ladder.

ponytail: thin httpx REST wrapper (~1 open + 1 snapshot + 1 close); no CLI
subprocess, no Playwright, no camofox SDK.
